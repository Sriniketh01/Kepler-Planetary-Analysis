## Kepler Exoplanet Data Analysis

### Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (Kepler_Data_Analysis.ipynb) designed to analyze data from the Kepler Space Telescope. The Kepler mission aimed to determine the frequency of Earth-like planets in the Milky Way by monitoring the brightness of over 150,000 stars for signs of planetary transits.

### Contents
Kepler_Data_Analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook that guides through the process of curating, preprocessing, visualizing, and analyzing Kepler's exoplanet data. It focuses on distinguishing confirmed exoplanets from false positives using data science techniques.

### Requirements
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas
4. NumPy
5. Matplotlib
6. Scikit-learn

### Usage
Clone this repository.

Install required packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (if a requirements file is provided).

Open Kepler_Data_Analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Run each cell to follow the analysis pipeline.

### Data Source
The data used in this project comes from the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) dataset, available at NASA's Exoplanet Archive.
